# bitcoin-bench

Someone told me using the default bitcoind debug.log may slow down the test. With this script, you can benchmark bitcoin node bootstrapping.  It writes a neat log file when you launch bitcoind with the script.  


### use

Download a bitcoin-core release and change into the directory bitcoin-0.12.0/bin.  Run bench.bash from that location as shown. The logfile will be created in the same directory.
